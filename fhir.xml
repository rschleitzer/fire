Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).</description></property>

        <property name="version" summary="true" id="activitydefinition.version"><description>The identifier that is used to identify this version of the activity definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the activity definition author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision Support Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification. Note that a version is required for non-experimental active assets.</description></property>

    <resource name="AdverseEvent" id="adverseevent">
      <description>An event (i.e. any change to current patient status) that may be related to unintended effects on a patient or research participant. The unintended effects may require additional monitoring, treatment, hospitalization, or may result in death. The AdverseEvent resource also extends to potential or avoided events that could have had such effects. There are two major domains where the AdverseEvent resource is expected to be used. One is in clinical care reported adverse events and the other is in reporting adverse events in clinical  research trial management.  Adverse events can be reported by healthcare providers, patients, caregivers or by medical products manufacturers.  Given the differences between these two concepts, we recommend consulting the domain specific implementation guides when implementing the AdverseEvent Resource. The implementation guides include specific extensions, value sets and constraints.</description>
      <properties>
        <property name="id" summary="true" id="adverseevent.id"><description>The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.</description></property>
        <property name="meta" type="element" ref="meta" summary="true" id="adverseevent.meta"><description>The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.</description></property>
        <property name="implicitRules" type="uri" summary="true" modifier="true" id="adverseevent.implicitrules"><description>A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.</description></property>

        <property name="text" type="element" ref="narrative" id="adverseevent.text"><description>A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it &quot;clinically safe&quot; for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.</description></property>
        <property name="contained" type="element" ref="resource" iscollection="true" id="adverseevent.contained"><description>These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.

        <property name="extension" type="element" ref="extension" iscollection="true" id="adverseevent.extension"><description>May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.</description></property>
        <property name="modifierExtension" type="element" ref="extension" iscollection="true" summary="true" modifier="true" id="adverseevent.modifierextension"><description>May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element&apos;s descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).</description></property>

      <properties>
        <property name="id" summary="true" id="basic.id"><description>The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.</description></property>
        <property name="meta" type="element" ref="meta" summary="true" id="basic.meta"><description>The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.</description></property>
        <property name="implicitRules" type="uri" summary="true" modifier="true" id="basic.implicitrules"><description>A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.</description></property>

The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it &quot;clinically safe&quot; for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.</description></property>
        <property name="contained" type="element" ref="resource" iscollection="true" id="basic.contained"><description>These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.</description></property>

Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).</description></property>

This referenced resource may be related to the Binary (e.g. DocumentReference), or may be some non-related Resource purely as a security proxy.

Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

This is an arbitrary value managed by the charge item definition author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision Support Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification. Note that a version is required for non-experimental active assets.</description></property>

      <description>A record of a clinical assessment performed to determine what problem(s) may affect the patient and before planning the treatments or management strategies that are best to manage a patient&apos;s condition. Assessments are often 1:1 with a clinical consultation / encounter,  but this varies greatly depending on the clinical workflow. This resource is called &quot;ClinicalImpression&quot; rather than &quot;ClinicalAssessment&quot; to avoid confusion with the recording of assessment tools such as Apgar score.</description>

      <description>A compartment definition that defines how resources are accessed on a server.</description>
      <properties>
        <property name="id" summary="true" id="compartmentdefinition.id"><description>The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.</description></property>
        <property name="meta" type="element" ref="meta" summary="true" id="compartmentdefinition.meta"><description>The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.</description></property>
        <property name="implicitRules" type="uri" summary="true" modifier="true" id="compartmentdefinition.implicitrules"><description>A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.</description></property>
        <property name="language" type="code" ref="language" id="compartmentdefinition.language"><description>The base language in which the resource is written.</description></property>
        <property name="text" type="element" ref="narrative" id="compartmentdefinition.text"><description>A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it &quot;clinically safe&quot; for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.</description></property>
        <property name="contained" type="element" ref="resource" iscollection="true" id="compartmentdefinition.contained"><description>These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.</description></property>
        <property name="extension" type="element" ref="extension" iscollection="true" id="compartmentdefinition.extension"><description>May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.</description></property>
        <property name="modifierExtension" type="element" ref="extension" iscollection="true" summary="true" modifier="true" id="compartmentdefinition.modifierextension"><description>May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element&apos;s descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).</description></property>
        <property name="url" type="uri" summary="true" id="compartmentdefinition.url"><description>An absolute URI that is used to identify this compartment definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal address at which an authoritative instance of this compartment definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the compartment definition is stored on different servers.</description></property>
        <property name="version" summary="true" id="compartmentdefinition.version"><description>The identifier that is used to identify this version of the compartment definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the compartment definition author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.</description></property>
        <property name="versionAlgorithm" type="variant" summary="true" id="compartmentdefinition.versionalgorithm">
          <description>Indicates the mechanism used to compare versions to determine which is more current.</description>

        <property name="name" summary="true" id="compartmentdefinition.name"><description>A natural language name identifying the compartment definition. This name should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such as code generation.</description></property>
        <property name="title" summary="true" id="compartmentdefinition.title"><description>A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the capability statement.</description></property>
        <property name="status" type="code" ref="publicationstatus" summary="true" modifier="true" id="compartmentdefinition.status"><description>The status of this compartment definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the content.</description></property>
        <property name="experimental" type="boolean" summary="true" id="compartmentdefinition.experimental"><description>A Boolean value to indicate that this compartment definition is authored for testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be used for genuine usage.</description></property>
        <property name="date" type="dateTime" summary="true" id="compartmentdefinition.date"><description>The date  (and optionally time) when the compartment definition was last significantly changed. The date must change when the business version changes and it must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the compartment definition changes.</description></property>

      <description>A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. A Composition defines the structure and narrative content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does not constitute a document. Rather, the Composition must be the first entry in a Bundle where Bundle.type=document, and any other resources referenced from Composition must be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle (for example Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.).</description>

Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).</description></property>

    <resource name="DocumentReference" id="documentreference">
      <description>A reference to a document of any kind for any purpose. While the term "document" implies a more narrow focus, for this resource this "document" encompasses *any* serialized object with a mime-type, it includes formal patient-centric documents (CDA), clinical notes, scanned paper, non-patient specific documents like policy text, as well as a photo, video, or audio recording acquired or used in healthcare.  The DocumentReference resource provides metadata about the document so that the document can be discovered and managed.  The actual content may be inline base64 encoded data or provided by direct reference.</description>
      <properties>
        <property name="id" summary="true" id="documentreference.id"><description>The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.</description></property>
        <property name="meta" type="element" ref="meta" summary="true" id="documentreference.meta"><description>The metadata about the resource.

        <property name="modifierExtension" type="element" ref="extension" iscollection="true" summary="true" modifier="true" id="documentreference.modifierextension"><description>May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element&apos;s descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).</description></property>

Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

      <properties>
        <property name="id" summary="true" id="implementationguide.id"><description>The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.</description></property>
        <property name="meta" type="element" ref="meta" summary="true" id="implementationguide.meta"><description>The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.</description></property>
        <property name="implicitRules" type="uri" summary="true" modifier="true" id="implementationguide.implicitrules"><description>A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it &quot;clinically safe&quot; for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.</description></property>
        <property name="contained" type="element" ref="resource" iscollection="true" id="implementationguide.contained"><description>These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.

Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).</description></property>

        <property name="version" summary="true" id="implementationguide.version"><description>The identifier that is used to identify this version of the implementation guide when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the implementation guide author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available.

Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).</description></property>

    <resource name="MedicationStatement" id="medicationstatement">
      <description>A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from sources such as the patient&apos;s memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.   The primary difference between a medicationstatement and a medicationadministration is that the medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the medication.  A medicationstatement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the Medication Statement information may come from the patient&apos;s memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.</description>

Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).</description></property>

The focus of an observation could also be an existing condition,  an intervention, the subject&apos;s diet,  another observation of the subject,  or a body structure such as tumor or implanted device.   An example use case would be using the Observation resource to capture whether the mother is trained to change her child&apos;s tracheostomy tube. In this example, the child is the patient of record and the mother is the focus.</description></property>

The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it &quot;clinically safe&quot; for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.</description></property>
        <property name="contained" type="element" ref="resource" iscollection="true" id="packagedproductdefinition.contained"><description>These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.</description></property>
        <property name="extension" type="element" ref="extension" iscollection="true" id="packagedproductdefinition.extension"><description>May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions.

Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).</description></property>
        <property name="identifier" type="element" ref="identifier" iscollection="true" summary="true" id="packagedproductdefinition.identifier"><description>A unique identifier for this package as whole - not the the content of the package. Unique instance identifiers assigned to a package by manufacturers, regulators, drug catalogue custodians or other organizations.</description></property>

        <property name="statusDate" type="dateTime" summary="true" id="packagedproductdefinition.statusdate"><description>The date at which the given status became applicable.</description></property>
        <property name="containedItemQuantity" type="element" ref="quantity" iscollection="true" summary="true" id="packagedproductdefinition.containeditemquantity"><description>A total of the complete count of contained items of a particular type/form, independent of sub-packaging or organization. This can be considered as the pack size. This attribute differs from containedItem.amount in that it can give a single aggregated count of all tablet types in a pack, even when these are different manufactured items. For example a pill pack of 21 tablets plus 7 sugar tablets, can be denoted here as &apos;28 tablets&apos;. This attribute is repeatable so that the different item types in one pack type can be counted (e.g. a count of vials and count of syringes). Each repeat must have different units, so that it is clear what the different sets of counted items are, and it is not intended to allow different counts of similar items (e.g. not &apos;2 tubes and 3 tubes&apos;). Repeats are not to be used to represent different pack sizes (e.g. 20 pack vs. 50 pack) - which would be different instances of this resource.</description></property>

      <description>Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource. Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.</description>

        <property name="meta" type="element" ref="meta" summary="true" id="terminologycapabilities.meta"><description>The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.</description></property>
        <property name="implicitRules" type="uri" summary="true" modifier="true" id="terminologycapabilities.implicitrules"><description>A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.</description></property>

The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it &quot;clinically safe&quot; for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.</description></property>
        <property name="contained" type="element" ref="resource" iscollection="true" id="terminologycapabilities.contained"><description>These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.</description></property>

To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.</description></property>

Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).</description></property>
